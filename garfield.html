                <p>Garfield, the lasagna-loving cat, finds himself on an adventure in the United Kingdom after sneaking into his owner Jon’s luggage. In a case of mistaken identity, Garfield is believed to be a royal cat named Prince, who has just inherited a castle. As Garfield enjoys the lavish lifestyle meant for Prince, the real heir to the castle, the nefarious Lord Dargis, plots to get rid of him to take over the estate.</p>

                <p>The film is a comedic tale of two cats with identical appearances but vastly different lives. Garfield’s usual antics are on full display as he navigates through the challenges of being mistaken for royalty and ultimately helps the animals of the castle stand against Lord Dargis’ schemes</p>
