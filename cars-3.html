                <p>The story follows the legendary race car Lightning McQueen, voiced by Owen Wilson, who finds himself being outpaced and overshadowed by a new generation of racers that utilize advanced technology to boost their performance. Among these is the exceptionally fast Jackson Storm.</p>

                <p>After a severe crash, McQueen must confront the possibility of retirement. Determined to return to the sport he loves, he seeks the help of a young race technician named Cruz Ramirez, who has her own plan to win. With inspiration from the late Fabulous Hudson Hornet and a few unexpected turns, McQueen prepares to prove that he’s still the best race car in the world on Piston Cup Racing’s biggest stage</p>
