                <p>In the year 2029, astronaut Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) is stationed on the space station Oberon, working closely with trained apes for space missions. His favorite, a chimpanzee named Pericles, is sent to navigate a storm but disappears. Defying orders, Leo follows in another pod, only to crash-land on a strange planet, Ashlar, in the year 5021.</p>

                <p>On Ashlar, Leo finds a world where intelligent apes rule over primitive humans, treating them as slaves. He is captured and sold to a kind-hearted chimpanzee activist, Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), who opposes the cruel treatment of humans. With Ari’s help, Leo sparks a rebellion and seeks a way back home.</p>

                <p>As Leo leads the human resistance, he discovers the planet’s dark secrets and the true nature of the apes’ dominion. The race is on to reach a sacred temple within the Forbidden Zone, which holds shocking revelations about mankind’s past and the key to its future</p>
